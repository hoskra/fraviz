## How to solve application issues

### "I played a song via my Spotify account and nothing happend."

- Please try to wait a little longer (problem may be caused by slow connection or by high graphical demands of Fraviz).
- If still nothing happens, please check errors in developer console.

### "There is an error in the developer console."

- ```GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT```
  - Turning off **Privacy Badger** or other cookie-manipulation addon of your browser may resolve this issue.

### "I have tried everything and the application is still not working."

- Try removing ```#start``` from the URL.
- Please try to refresh your browser or try switching to different browser.
